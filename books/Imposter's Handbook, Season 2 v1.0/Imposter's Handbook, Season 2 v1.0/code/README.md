# The Feedback Repo for the The Imposter's Handbook, Season 2

Welcome, and thanks for dropping by. This is the feedback and code repository for Big Machine's [The Imposter's Handbook, Season 2](https://bigmachine.io/). We're actively writing this book and altering the code you see here, so if you see any issues in the book or the code, please pop them in the issues list.

## Organization

The code is organized by chapter (03, 06, etc) and within each chapter directory is a file that corresponds to a section of code within the book. I wanted to try to keep examples together so they made sense.

## Running Things
Be sure to execute `npm install` when you download this repo - this will enable the `AsciiTable` package that's used for some of the binary demos.
